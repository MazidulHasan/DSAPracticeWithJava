Cosntructor::
    A constructor in Java is a special method that is used to initialize objects. The constructor is called when an object of a 
    class is created. It can be used to set initial values for object attributes.Every time an object is created using the new() 
    keyword, at least one constructor is called.

    

    Remember: Does constructor return any value?

    There are no “return value” statements in the constructor, but the constructor returns the current class instance. We can write 
    ‘return’ inside a constructor.

Questions::
    What is a constructor in Java?
        A constructor in Java is a special method with the same name as the class, used to initialize objects of that class. It is called automatically when an object is created.

    How is a constructor different from a regular method?
        Constructors have the same name as the class and are used for initializing objects, while regular methods perform specific tasks or operations.

    Can a class have multiple constructors?
        Yes, a class can have multiple constructors. This is known as constructor overloading.

    What is the purpose of a default constructor?
        The default constructor is automatically provided by Java if no constructors are explicitly defined. It initializes object attributes to their default values.

    How do you invoke a constructor in Java?
        A constructor is invoked using the new keyword followed by the class name and a set of parentheses containing any required arguments.

    Can a constructor have a return type?
        No, a constructor does not have a return type, not even void. Its purpose is to initialize the object, and it returns an instance of the class.

    What happens if you don't define a constructor in a class?
        If no constructor is defined, Java provides a default constructor. If any constructor is explicitly defined, the default constructor is not automatically added.

    Explain the concept of constructor overloading.
        Constructor overloading is the ability to define multiple constructors in a class, each with a different signature (different parameters).

    Can you call one constructor from another constructor in the same class?
        Yes, using the this() keyword, a constructor can call another constructor in the same class.

    What is the significance of the this keyword in a constructor?
        The this keyword is used to refer to the current instance of the class. It is often used to differentiate instance variables from parameters with the same name.

    Can a constructor be private?
        Yes, a constructor can be private. This is often used in Singleton patterns or utility classes where you want to control the instantiation of objects.

    How is a parameterized constructor different from a default constructor?
        A parameterized constructor takes parameters, allowing you to initialize object attributes with specific values during object creation. A default constructor takes no parameters.

    What is the role of the super keyword in a constructor?
        The super keyword is used to call the constructor of the superclass. It is often used in the constructor of a subclass to invoke the constructor of the superclass.

    How is the order of execution for instance variable initialization and constructor in Java?
        Instance variables are initialized before the constructor is executed.

    What is the purpose of the static keyword in a constructor?
        Constructors cannot be static. They are called on instances of the class and not on the class itself.

    Explain the difference between constructors and static methods.
        Constructors are used to initialize objects, whereas static methods belong to the class and are called on the class itself, not on instances.

    Can you create an object without invoking a constructor?
        No, an object is always created by invoking a constructor.

    What is the purpose of the final keyword in a constructor?
        The final keyword in a constructor prevents the class from being subclassed or the method from being overridden.

    How does constructor chaining work in Java?
        Constructor chaining is the process of calling one constructor from another within the same class using the this() keyword.

    Can you have a constructor in an interface in Java?
        No, interfaces cannot have constructors in Java. They are meant to declare methods that implementing classes must implement.
