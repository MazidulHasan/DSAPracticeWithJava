> We can cast data from low premetive data type to higher data type
Serial:::
byte > sort > char > int > long > float > double

so we can do wideing and Narrowing

wideing: converting lower data to higher
    long l1 = 1000;
    float f1 =l1;

Narrowing: converting higher data to lower (Needs casting)
    int n = 200;
    byte byt = (byte) n;
